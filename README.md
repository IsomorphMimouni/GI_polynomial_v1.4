## 🚀 Overview

**GI_polynomial** is an efficient graph isomorphism algorithm designed to handle large graphs using a novel labeling and tree-based approach.  
This version (v1.4) significantly improves performance on rigid graphs with thousands of vertices.

The algorithm is implemented in **Python 3** and uses a **SQLite** database for structured data management.

## 🧠 Key Features

- Polynomial-time labeling heuristic
- Label propagation using pseudo-trees
- Multi-stage verification (vertices and edges)
- Supports large graphs (tested on 4,000+ vertices)
- Automatically detects isomorphic mappings
- Command-based modular execution (`01_install.py` to `12_fin.py`)
